### To run the app we have two options one is with docker and other is on local

### OPTION 1

## Running with Docker

Alternatively, you can run the project using Docker, which simplifies the setup process. Make sure you have Docker installed on your system. If you don't have it installed, you can download and install it from the official website: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

To run the project with Docker, use the following Makefile commands:

1. Install dependencies mentioned in package.json file:

- `make install`

2. Compile the build:

- `make build`

3. Start your dev server and launch the containers:

- `make start-dev`

To stop the development server and associated containers, run:

- `make stop-dev`

**Note:**

1. If you encounter any issues or want to customize the Docker configuration, you can modify the `docker-compose.builder.yml` file.

2. Remember to keep your Docker environment updated and clean regularly using appropriate commands like `docker system prune`.

3. Docker is only setup for development environment.

### OPTION 2
